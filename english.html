                        <p> Blue April is celebrated every year as the month dedicated to autism awareness. During this
                            period, landmarks in Brazil and around the world are illuminated in blue, the color that
                            symbolizes Autism Spectrum Disorder. Various campaigns aim to share information, combat
                            prejudice, and encourage inclusive attitudes in everyday life. Autism is characterized by
                            different forms of communication, behavior, and social interaction. Because it is an
                            invisible disability, it is often not noticeable at first glance, which leads to the
                            mistaken and ableist idea that an autistic person “doesn’t look autistic.” Autism is a
                            spectrum. Each autistic person expresses their characteristics in a unique way. No one
                            “looks autistic”. They simply are. </p>

                        <p> Yellow May is an international awareness movement that aims to reduce accidents and promote
                            road safety. Created in 2014, the movement seeks to draw society’s attention to the high
                            number of deaths and injuries on the roads, encouraging respect for traffic laws and
                            responsible behavior. Throughout the month of May, public agencies, schools, companies, and
                            organizations hold lectures, campaigns, and educational actions focused on prevention. The
                            movement reinforces that road safety is everyone’s responsibility: pedestrians, cyclists,
                            motorcyclists, and drivers alike. By adopting safe behaviors—such as not using a cellphone
                            while driving, respecting speed limits, and wearing a seat belt—each person contributes to
                            saving lives and making traffic more humane and aware. </p>

                        <p> Red June is a national campaign created to encourage blood donation, especially because
                            winter often leads to a decrease in the number of donors. The month is marked by
                            mobilization efforts in blood centers and healthcare institutions. A single donation can
                            save up to four lives, as the collected blood is separated into different components, such
                            as platelets, plasma, and red blood cells. These elements are essential for treating
                            patients with cancer, severe anemia, accident victims, and people undergoing surgery.
                            Donating blood is a voluntary, compassionate, and safe act. The entire process is carried
                            out with disposable materials and qualified professionals. Participating in this campaign is
                            a gesture of empathy and citizenship, showing how small individual actions can lead to
                            significant transformations in society. </p>

                    <p>
                        This cool color is associated with the mind and intellect. It gives a sense of calm and
                        tranquility, evoking the sea, water, and the night. Blue is the color of wisdom, integrity, and
                        knowledge; it enhances creativity and clarity of thought, bringing a sense of safety and trust.
                        In lighter shades, it works well with themes aimed at children. In darker tones, it is widely
                        used in business and education. <br>
                        The color blue was chosen as the symbol of the campaign, representing tranquility and the need

                        On one hand, it is a joyful and dynamic color that symbolizes celebration. On the other, it is

                        also linked to gold, money, and luxury. Additionally, in nature, yellow often signals danger, as
                        seen in wasps or bees. <br> The color yellow was selected for the campaign because it symbolizes
                        attention, alertness, and warning, connecting to traffic signs.

                        represents the blood that saves lives, and the initiative seeks to encourage donation to
                        increase supplies in blood centers. For this reason, it was chosen as the color for the month of

                        <p>
                            Green April is a campaign focused on preventing accidents and illnesses related to the work
                            environment. The initiative aims to promote care-oriented actions and encourage safe
                            practices in the daily routines of companies and workers. The movement originated in 1968,
                            after the tragic Farmington Mine Disaster in the United States, which resulted in the deaths
                            of 78 workers. In 2003, the International Labour Organization (ILO) established April 28 as
                            the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, in honor of the victims of that accident.
                            According to data from SmartLab — the Occupational Safety and Health Observatory — Brazil is
                            among the countries with the highest number of workplace accidents. Every 51 seconds an
                            accident occurs, and every four hours someone dies as a result. Green April encourages the
                            creation of a safety culture that goes beyond simply complying with regulatory standards.
                            Promoting prevention is essential to ensuring workers’ well-being and reducing costs related
                            to absences and compensation.

                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            iridescent may  is a campaign that aims to bring visibility to maternal mental health. The name symbolizes the idea that, just as an iridescent surface reveals multiple colors as the light shifts, motherhood is also complex and shaped by many emotions: joy, love, exhaustion, fear, guilt, and vulnerability. The campaign highlights how many women face intense social pressure to be “perfect,” deal with physical and mental overload, and often silence their own suffering. Conditions such as postpartum depression, anxiety, maternal exhaustion, and parental burnout are common, yet still surrounded by stigma. By promoting information, welcoming support, and building a network of care, iridescent may  reinforces that caring for maternal mental health is not a luxury, but a necessity. The initiative encourages mothers to be heard, to seek help without guilt, and calls on society to take responsibility in supporting the women who care for, raise, and sustain so many lives.

                        <p>
                            Green June is a month entirely dedicated to environmental awareness and protection, emphasizing the importance of rethinking habits and strengthening sustainable actions in daily life. The campaign invites society to reflect on the impact of human activities on nature, highlighting themes such as biodiversity preservation, pollution reduction, combating deforestation, and encouraging the circular economy. Throughout the month, schools, companies, public institutions, and communities often promote educational initiatives, tree planting, cleanup efforts, discussions on climate change, and actions aimed at the responsible use of natural resources.More than a symbolic observance, Green June reinforces that protecting the environment is essential to ensuring quality of life, health, and balance for future generations.

                        This website was developed for an interdisciplinary activity at ETEC. Using HTML, CSS,
                        Bootstrap, and JavaScript, we created a page that brings together the main knowledge acquired
                        throughout the semester. The project combines concepts of digital design, web programming,
                        teamwork, ethics, English, and software operation.
